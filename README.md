# Hi there! 👋 I'm Shane, a Web Developer!

## Who Am I?

I'm the guy who spends way too much time in front of a screen, making cool things happen on the web. If you're wondering what I bring to the table, here's the scoop:

- **Laravel/PHP Whisperer:** Laravel is my jam. I've wielded PHP to create some snazzy web applications, and I'm always looking for ways to make my code cleaner, faster, and more efficient. If you've got a Laravel project that needs some TLC, I'm your go-to person.

- **Node.js Ninja:** When it comes to the backend, Node.js is my trusty sidekick. I've built RESTful APIs, real-time apps, and everything in between. If you want to talk JavaScript on both sides of the fence, I'm all ears.

- **JavaScript Sorcerer:** I'm fluent in the mystical arts of JavaScript. React, Vue, vanilla JS – you name it, I've tamed it. Frontend development is where the magic happens, and I'm all about crafting pixel-perfect interfaces.

## What's in My Toolbox?

You know that saying, "Give a developer the right tools, and they'll build amazing things"? Well, here are some of my trusty tools of the trade:

- **Laravel:** It's like my second language. From authentication to Eloquent relationships, I've got Laravel's secrets down pat.

- **PHP:** My trusty steed for server-side scripting. PHP may not be the shiny new kid on the block, but it gets the job done.

- **Node.js:** For all things server-side, Node.js is my go-to. It's fast, scalable, and oh-so-versatile.

- **JavaScript:** From ES6 to the latest and greatest, I can whip up JavaScript like nobody's business.

- **React:** I've built single-page apps, dynamic interfaces, and more with React. It's my choice for crafting beautiful user experiences.

- **Vue.js:** Vue is my other love. It's simple, powerful, and great for building interactive web applications.
