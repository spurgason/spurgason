I work as a Full-Stack Flex (MERN stack) instructor and tutor at Trilogy Education. I am currently based in Wilmington, North Carolina.

I have been developing my coding skills since 2021 once I found my passion for coding. Since then, I have spent my time learning new technolgies and and enforcing my current understanding of programming. I emphasaize on responsive and dynamic websites, or applications that enguage users while bringing value to their everyday lives. 

As a developer, I am always finding ways to grow and expand my knowledge because learning something new is always exciting. I enjoy working on collaborative projects where my skills can be put to use to create easy-to-use and enjoyable applications. Outside of coding I enjoy learning new languages and reading clasical litirature.

## What I'm up to
Currently, I am working on enforcing my skills in React, JavaScript, Python, and React Native. Also, I am broadening my knowledge in SQL and NoSQL databases. 

As for learning new things, I am teaching myself machine learning with Python & R as well as advanced JavaScript algorithms and data structures.
